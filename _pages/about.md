I'm a third year PhD student at INRIA under the supervison of [Julie Josse](http://juliejosse.com) and [Erwan Scornet](https://erwanscornet.github.io). My research lies at the intersection of causal inference, statistical learning, and generalization theory. I aim to understand how causal conclusions drawn from one environment can remain valid in others. My work focuses on theoretical and methodological approaches to improve the external validity of causal inference, studying both identifiability conditions and robust estimation procedures under distributional shifts. I'm also interrested in meta-analysis. Before starting my PhD, I earned my Master’s in Applied Mathematics at [Ecole des ponts][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/École_nationale_des_ponts_et_chaussées] and [MVA][https://www.master-mva.com]. Outside of research, I’m passionate about track and field, where I compete at a regional level, and I enjoy climbing and outdoor activities

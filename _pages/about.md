I'm a first year PhD student at INRIA under the supervison of Julie Josse [Julie Josse](http://juliejosse.com) and [Erwan Scornet](https://erwanscornet.github.io). My research focuses on causal inference and more precisely the combining experimental and observational data to determine a treatment effect.

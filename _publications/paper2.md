permalink: /publication/2025-05-22-stable-missing-data
excerpt: 'This paper proposes a general and unified framework for learning from missing data in a stable manner. It addresses both the theoretical and practical challenges that arise when building machine learning models in the presence of missingness. By developing a principled approach grounded in statistical theory, the authors offer algorithms that provide robustness to different missingness mechanisms. The methods are validated through extensive simulations and real-world datasets.'

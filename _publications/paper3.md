title: "Adaptive Estimation of Treatment Effects with Partially Observed Confounders"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-05-30-partially-observed-confounders
excerpt: 'This work addresses the challenge of estimating treatment effects when some confounding variables are partially observed or missing. The authors develop adaptive estimators that remain valid under various assumptions on the missingness pattern. The methodology is supported by theoretical guarantees and empirical evaluation on semi-synthetic datasets.'
